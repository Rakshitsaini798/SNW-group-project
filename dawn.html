      <p class="desc">
        A quiet engineer is paired with a fallen prince on a silent-run cargo ship. Slow-burn banter, found family, and an AI that ships them harder than the crew does.

      <h2>Story</h2>

      <p class="desc">
        On deck twelve, the AI dimmed the stars to help the prince sleep. The engineer stayed up anyway, humming a half-remembered flight song the ship seemed to enjoy. They traced lazy constellations along the viewport—routes no royal court would ever sign off on.
      </p>

      <p class="desc">
        “You’re awake,” the prince murmured, voice barely louder than the reactor’s low hum.
      </p>

      <p class="desc">
        “Systems don’t really sleep,” the engineer said. “And people planning to steal a kingdom back? They barely nap.”
      </p>

      <p class="desc">
        The prince laughed—soft, shaky, like relief pretending to be confidence. “You think we can actually pull it off?”
      </p>

      <p class="desc">
        “We’re already doing it,” the engineer said, nodding toward the cargo bay. The crew was running silent drills again, moving like shadows. The AI washed the walls in a slow lavender glow—its version of a thumbs-up. Somewhere below, someone fiddled with a battered radio, trying to drown nerves with old love songs.
      </p>

      <p class="desc">
        Later, when an alarm hiccuped and faded, the engineer covered the prince’s trembling hands. “We’ll rewrite the flight plan as many times as we need,” they said. “Dawn’s not a destination—it’s a choice we keep making together.”
