      <h2>Story</h2>

      <p class="desc">
        The blade dipped lower as the truth finally came loose—like a banner stitched by the wrong hands. The so-called villain held the heir’s gaze and said, “Check the ledger sewn inside your mother’s cloak.”
      </p>

      <p class="desc">
        When the cloak was opened, letters tumbled out—years of intercepted messages, proof that someone else had been quietly turning them against each other. Gasps rippled through the court. The heir reached out; the former villain let out a breath that was half-laughter, half-relief.
      </p>

      <p class="desc">
        “Rewrite with me?” they asked.
      </p>

      <p class="desc">
        The heir paused only long enough to drop the blade. Instead, they offered a pen. “Let’s fix what we both inherited.”
      </p>

      <p class="desc">
        That night, they rewrote laws side by side, ink drying over promises of shared power—and a future built on chosen family instead of fear. Outside, lanterns flickered as crowds read the new decrees and, for once, believed the crown might actually listen.
