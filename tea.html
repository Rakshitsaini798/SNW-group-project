    <h1 style="margin-top: 10px;">Tea with the Dragon</h1>

    <p class="desc">
      The town dragon had taken a barista job—mostly just to hang around humans without scaring anyone. 
      Somehow, latte art became part of their routine. 
      Not that anyone expected a dragon to be good at it.

    <h2>Story</h2>

    <p class="desc">
      Scales glimmered in the warm café light as claws drew a fern into the foam. 
      Customers whispered about the barista’s steady hands. 
      They had no idea those same hands could lift a cottage if they tried.
    </p>

    <p class="desc">
      A kid pressed their nose against the counter. “How do you make the leaves look so real?”
    </p>

    <p class="desc">
      The dragon grinned, letting out a soft puff of steam. 
      “Patience. And don’t scorch the milk.” 
      Laughter bubbled up along the line, chasing away the morning chill.
    </p>

    <p class="desc">
      By afternoon, the dragon shrank down to fit the backroom stool, 
      practicing latte hearts until their claws cramped. 
      A coworker tossed them a honey bun. “Breaks are part of the craft,” she said.
    </p>

    <p class="desc">
      Outside, rain tapped the windows. Inside, warmth, milk, and quiet laughter filled the room. 
      And for the first time, the dragon realized that maybe this—tiny, ordinary, human—was what hoarding happiness looked like.
