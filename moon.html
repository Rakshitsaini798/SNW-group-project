      <h2>Story</h2>

      <p class="desc">
        Ink smudged like moonlight, the script curved in that familiar way—only one person wrote like that. The courier wasn’t supposed to miss them, but here they were, reading each word twice.
      </p>

      <p class="desc">
        Tonight’s letter had a weight to it. A bit of pressure behind the strokes. 
        <em>Meet me where the wards thin. I’m tired of walls. —L.</em>
      </p>

      <p class="desc">
        They tucked the letter inside their coat and took off across the courtyard. A few lanterns flickered awake as they passed, like they were rooting for them. The wards around the old archway hummed gently—listening, almost.
      </p>

      <p class="desc">
        L waited there, fingers stained with ink, smile shaky. “I kept writing so I wouldn’t forget the sound of my own voice,” they said quietly.
      </p>

      <p class="desc">
        “Then stay,” the courier said, offering a hand. “We’ll talk until sunrise.”  
        And the wards, stubborn as they were, slowly parted—letting the two towers that had kept them apart hear the beginning of a brand-new truce.
